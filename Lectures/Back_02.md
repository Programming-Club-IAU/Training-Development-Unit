## 🧠 Milestone 1
Make a website that implements a basic front-end and a back-end. Make the front-end however you would like. But the back-end has to contain the following:

- Functions
- Classes (Curve ball, I know.)
- Arrays (only if it makes sense to use arrays)
- Form handling
- Sessions
- And at least two *non-core* extensions

Extensions are similar to libraries in Python and C++\
A list of extensions can be found [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/extensions.membership.php)\
There are no restrictions as to what you can make. Go nuts :]
