## Week 04: 🌐 Web Basics Part 3 - CSS Basics


This week, we began our **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** journey, the language that brings style, structure, and beauty to the web.  

We explored what CSS is, why it’s essential, and how it helps us control the **look and feel** of our web pages. We also learned about **selectors**, the foundation of every CSS rule, which allow us to target and style specific HTML elements.  

Finally, we practiced **linking CSS files** to HTML documents and experimented with **core CSS properties** like colors, fonts, and the box model to see how each one shapes the overall layout and design of a page.
