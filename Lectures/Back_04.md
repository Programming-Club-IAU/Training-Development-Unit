## Week 08: ⚙ Connecting and operating a Database via PHP

Our last lecture will look at how a Back-end will connect with a database via an API, How statements can be executed from PHP on the database, and look at Object-Relational Mappings, which are libraries (extensions in PHP) that can make it easier to create SQL statements using PHP objects.

## 🧠 Assignment
Create a REST API that will connect to your SQLite database (either create a new one or use the one from your previous assignment) Setup each request to perform some operation (GET will query, POST will insert, PUT will update, DELETE will delete, etc) then setup an HTTP webpage with buttons that will connect to this backend and perform the expected operations
