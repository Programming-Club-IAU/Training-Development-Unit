## 🧠 MILESTONE 1 ASSIGNMENT:

Create a simple scrollable Flutter page using the widgets introduced in weeks 3 & 4.

The app idea is up to your creativity! Choose an idea you like, then look for UI inspiration to help you design a professional and clean page.


Here are some examples if you need ideas, but you can definitely come up with your own:
    
    
- Product Showcase Page:
    - A product image, title, description, features, and price.


- Travel Destination Page
    - Images of a place with descriptions, highlights, and facts.

- Recipe Page
    - Recipe image, ingredients list, and step-by-step instructions.


Your Flutter app should include:

1. A proper app structure
    - Use MaterialApp and Scaffold as the base structure.
    - Add an AppBar with a suitable title.
2. Scrollable body
    - Use SingleChildScrollView to allow vertical scrolling.
3. Layout organization
    - Use a combination of layout widgets such as:
    - Column, Row, Container, Padding, Align, Center, or Expanded.
4. Content Elements
    - Use as many (Text, icons, images) as you need.
